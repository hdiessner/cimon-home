CIMON@home is a private project of a astronomy enthusiast interested in space and technology.
Transferring developments from and for space exploration is an interesting subject - especially when there is potential to make use of it in our everyday life. Even better when it also could be used for STEM education of kids.
All this led to the idea to try to create a CIMON for home use.
