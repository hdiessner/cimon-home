## CIMON@home

# Build your own CIMON for home use

Very likely you heard about CIMON, the first AI astronaut assistancs system that is currently being tested on the [ISS](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/live-iss-stream). Having seen this in the news the tought came to mind: can you build this yourself for use at home?

This is the place where we want to try and build a CIMON like home assistant.

Over on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2949975), there's already a design available for 3D printing. If you print it with 50% scale on all axes, your CIMON@home would be handy but still big enough to hold a Raspberry Pi with a Display, Camera, Microphone(s) and Speaker.

As the original CIMON is using heavily cloud services, the hardware setup of you CIMON@home would be sufficient to use cloud services aswell.

N.B. This is work / trial in progress - so don't expect a documentation or how-to to build your own rather see this page as an inspiration for how you can try and explore yourself! Have fun!
